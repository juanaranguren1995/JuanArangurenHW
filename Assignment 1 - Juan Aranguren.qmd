# Data Manipulation

## Problem 1: Use logical operators to find flights that:

```         
-   Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (\> 120 minutes)
-   Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
-   Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)
-   Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
-   Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
-   Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
```

```{r}
#| label: problem-1

# Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (> 120 minutes)
flights %>%
  filter(arr_delay >= 120)

# Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
  filter(flights, dest == "IAH"|dest == "HOU")
  

# Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)
  filter(flights, carrier == "UA"|carrier == "AA"|carrier == "DL")  


# Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
  filter(flights, month == 7 |month == 8 |month == 9)   
  
# Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
flights %>% 
  filter (dep_delay <= 0, arr_delay > 120)

# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
flights %>% 
  filter (dep_delay >= 60, arr_delay < 30)


```

## Problem 2: What months had the highest and lowest proportion of cancelled flights? Interpret any seasonal patterns. To determine if a flight was cancelled use the following code

<!-- -->

```         
flights %>% 
  filter(is.na(dep_time)) 
```

```{r}
#| label: problem-2

# What months had the highest and lowest % of cancelled flights?
#Filter by cancelled flights, grouping by month and counting the percentage of cancelled flights by month

library(nycflights13)
flights %>%
  filter(is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
  group_by (month) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = count/sum(count))
            

```

## Problem 3: What plane (specified by the `tailnum` variable) traveled the most times from New York City airports in 2013? Please `left_join()` the resulting table with the table `planes` (also included in the `nycflights13` package).

For the plane with the greatest number of flights and that had more than 50 seats, please create a table where it flew to during 2013.

```{r}
library(nycflights13)

#Generate a table that counts the amount of flights per plane in 2013 and arranges it in descending order
most_frequent_plane <- flights %>%
  filter(year == 2013) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>% 
  group_by (tailnum,origin) %>% 
  summarise(total_flights = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(total_flights))
most_frequent_plane
 
#Join with planes table and filter for flights with more than 50 seats
More_50 <- left_join(most_frequent_plane, planes, by="tailnum", na_matches = "never") %>% 
  filter(seats>50)
More_50

#Present the result for the flight N328AA with the highest amount of trips
Final_Answer <- flights %>% 
  filter(tailnum=="N328AA") %>% 
  group_by(tailnum,dest) %>% 
  summarise(total_flights=n(), .groups="drop") %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_flights))
Final_Answer

```

## Problem 4: The `nycflights13` package includes a table (`weather`) that describes the weather during 2013. Use that table to answer the following questions:

```         
-   What is the distribution of temperature (`temp`) in July 2013? Identify any important outliers in terms of the `wind_speed` variable.
-   What is the relationship between `dewp` and `humid`?
-   What is the relationship between `precip` and `visib`?
```

```{r}

#What is the distribution of temperature (`temp`) in July 2013? Identify any important outliers in terms of the `wind_speed` variable.

library(nycflights13)

#tilter wheater data for 7/2013
weather_july <- filter(weather, month == 7, year == 2013)

#Generate the distribution of temp
summary(weather_july$temp)

#Detect the possible outliers based on windspeed
outliers <- boxplot.stats(weather_july$wind_speed)$out
outliers


# What is the relationship between `dewp` and `humid`?
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)

#Scatter plot of dewp and humid
ggplot(weather, aes(x = dewp, y = humid)) +
  geom_point () +
  labs(x = "Dew Point Temperature", y = "Humidity") +
  ggtitle ("Relationship between Dew Point Temperature and Humidity")

#Generate a correlation analysis
correlation <- cor(weather$dewp, weather$humid)
correlation

# What is the relationship between `precip` and `visib`?
# we use a very similar code than before,adapting for the new variables
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)

#Scatter plot of precip and visib
ggplot(weather, aes(x = precip, y = visib)) +
  geom_point () +
  labs(x = "Precipitation", y = "Visibility") +
  ggtitle ("Relationship between Precipitation and Visibility")

#Generate a correlation analysis
correlation <- cor(weather$precip, weather$visib)
correlation





```

## Problem 5: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

```         
-   How many planes have a missing date of manufacture?
-   What are the five most common manufacturers?
-   Has the distribution of manufacturer changed over time as reflected by the airplanes flying from NYC in 2013? (Hint: you may need to use case_when() to recode the manufacturer name and collapse rare vendors into a category called Other.)
```

```{r}

#How many planes have a missing date of manufacture?
library(nycflights13)

#filter planes without date of manufacture in the table 
no_manufacture_date <- planes[is.na(planes$year), ]

#count all the planes that do not have a date of manufacture
nrow(no_manufacture_date)

# What are the five most common manufacturers?
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

#Calculate how many planes each manufcturer has
Num_planes <- planes %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

#select the top 5
Top_5 <- head(Num_planes, 5)

#Show results
Top_5

# Has the distribution of manufacturer changed over time as reflected by the airplanes flying from NYC in 2013?

library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# Join both tables
joined_data <- flights %>%
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum")

# Filter for flights from NYC in 2013
filtered_data <- joined_data %>%
  filter(year.x == 2013)

# Renamed manufacturer names
New_names <- filtered_data %>%
  mutate(manufacturer = case_when(
    manufacturer %in% c("BOEING", "AIRBUS", "EMBRAER") ~ manufacturer,
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

# Calculate manufacturers share by month
manufacturer_share <- New_names %>%
  group_by(month, manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop_last") %>%
  arrange(month, desc(count))

# Calculate cumulative percentages by month
manufacturer_share <- manufacturer_share %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_percentage = cumsum(count) / sum(count) * 100)

# Genearte chart with ggplot for the share of each manufacurer
ggplot(manufacturer_share, aes(x = month, y = cumulative_percentage, group = manufacturer, color = manufacturer)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_area(aes(fill = manufacturer), position = "identity", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Cumulative Share", fill = "Manufacturer", color = "Manufacturer") +
  ggtitle("Cumulative Share of Manufacturers by Month in 2013") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb)

# Result explanation: Upon analyzing the chart, it appears that the distribution of manufacturers for airplanes flying from NYC in 2013 remained relatively stable over time, with minimal changes in market share among different manufacturers.
```

## Problem 6: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

```         
-   What is the oldest plane (specified by the tailnum variable) that flew from New York City airports in 2013?
-   How many airplanes that flew from New York City are included in the planes table?
```

```{r}

# What is the oldest plane (specified by the tailnum variable) that flew from New York City airports in 2013?
library (nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

#Search in the table planes and detect the oldest plane which is N365AA
planes %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer,tailnum) %>% 
  reframe(min=year)

#Filter table flights by plane N365AA
flights %>% 
  filter(tailnum=="N365AA")

Oldest <- left_join(planes, flights, by="tailnum", na_matches = "never")

# How many airplanes that flew from New York City are included in the planes table?
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

#Select flights for NYC 
Flights_NYC <- flights %>%
  filter(origin %in% c("JFK", "LGA", "EWR"))

# Create a join with planes table by tailnum
Planes_from_NYC <- Flights_NYC %>%
  inner_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  distinct(tailnum)

# Count the number of airplanes
Q_Planes <- nrow(Planes_from_NYC)

# Display the result
Q_Planes
```

## Problem 7: Use the `nycflights13` to answer the following questions:

```         
-   What is the median arrival delay on a month-by-month basis in each airport?
-   For each airline, plot the median arrival delay for each month and origin airport.
```

```{r}
#What is the median arrival delay on a month-by-month basis in each airport?
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# Median Arrival Delay for each airport
Median_Arrival_Delay <- flights %>%
  group_by(month, origin) %>%
  summarise(median_arrival_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

# Show the result
Median_Arrival_Delay

# For each airline, plot the median arrival delay for each month and origin airport
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Calculate median arrival delay for each airline, month, and origin airport
Median_Arrival_delay <- flights %>%
  group_by(carrier, month, origin) %>%
  summarise(Median_Arrival_Delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

# Use ggplot to generate a graph  for the median arrival delay for each airline
ggplot(Median_Arrival_delay, aes(x = month, y = Median_Arrival_Delay, color = origin)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ carrier, nrow = 2) +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Median Arrival Delay", color = "Origin") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Problem 8: Let's take a closer look at what carriers service the route to San Francisco International (SFO). Join the `flights` and `airlines` tables and count which airlines flew the most to SFO. Produce a new dataframe, `fly_into_sfo` that contains three variables: the `name` of the airline, e.g., `United Air Lines Inc.` not `UA`, the count (number) of times it flew to SFO, and the `percent` of the trips that that particular airline flew to SFO.

```{r}

library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# Inner join of flights and airlines tables
fly_into_sfo <- flights %>%
  inner_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  filter(dest == "SFO") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# Display the resulting dataframe
#fly_into_sfo

fly_into_sfo %>% 
  
  # sort 'name' of airline by the numbers it times to flew to SFO
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, count)) %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  
  aes(x = count, 
      y = name) +
  
  # a simple bar/column plot
  geom_col() +
  
  # add labels, so each bar shows the % of total flights 
  geom_text(aes(label = percent),
             hjust = 1, 
             colour = "white", 
             size = 5)+
  
  # add labels to help our audience  
  labs(title="Which airline dominates the NYC to SFO route?", 
       subtitle = "as % of total flights in 2013",
       x= "Number of flights",
       y= NULL) +
  
  theme_minimal() + 
  
  # change the theme-- i just googled those , but you can use the ggThemeAssist add-in
  # https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggThemeAssist/index.html
  
  theme(#
    # so title is left-aligned
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    
    # text in axes appears larger        
    axis.text = element_text(size=12),
    
    # title text is bigger
    plot.title = element_text(size=18)
      ) +

  # add one final layer of NULL, so if you comment out any lines
  # you never end up with a hanging `+` that awaits another ggplot layer
  NULL

```

And here is some bonus ggplot code to plot your dataframe

```{r}
#| label: ggplot-flights-toSFO
#| message: false
#| warning: false

fly_into_sfo %>% 
  
  # sort 'name' of airline by the numbers it times to flew to SFO
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, count)) %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  
  aes(x = count, 
      y = name) +
  
  # a simple bar/column plot
  geom_col() +
  
  # add labels, so each bar shows the % of total flights 
  geom_text(aes(label = percent),
             hjust = 1, 
             colour = "white", 
             size = 5)+
  
  # add labels to help our audience  
  labs(title="Which airline dominates the NYC to SFO route?", 
       subtitle = "as % of total flights in 2013",
       x= "Number of flights",
       y= NULL) +
  
  theme_minimal() + 
  
  # change the theme-- i just googled those , but you can use the ggThemeAssist add-in
  # https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggThemeAssist/index.html
  
  theme(#
    # so title is left-aligned
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    
    # text in axes appears larger        
    axis.text = element_text(size=12),
    
    # title text is bigger
    plot.title = element_text(size=18)
      ) +

  # add one final layer of NULL, so if you comment out any lines
  # you never end up with a hanging `+` that awaits another ggplot layer
  NULL
 
 
```

## Problem 9: Let's take a look at cancellations of flights to SFO. We create a new dataframe `cancellations` as follows

```{r}

cancellations <- flights %>% 
  
  # just filter for destination == 'SFO'
  filter(dest == 'SFO') %>% 
  
  # a cancelled flight is one with no `dep_time` 
  filter(is.na(dep_time))


```

I want you to think how we would organise our data manipulation to create the following plot. No need to write the code, just explain in words how you would go about it.

In order to create the following graph I would need to use ggplot using the face wrap function by origin and carrier, plotting cancellations in each graph. I would also define X as month and number of cancellations as Y.

## Problem 10: On your own -- Hollywood Age Gap

The website https://hollywoodagegap.com is a record of *THE AGE DIFFERENCE IN YEARS BETWEEN MOVIE LOVE INTERESTS*. This is an informational site showing the age gap between movie love interests and the data follows certain rules:

-   The two (or more) actors play actual love interests (not just friends, coworkers, or some other non-romantic type of relationship)
-   The youngest of the two actors is at least 17 years old
-   No animated characters

The age gaps dataset includes "gender" columns, which always contain the values "man" or "woman". These values appear to indicate how the characters in each film identify and some of these values do not match how the actor identifies. We apologize if any characters are misgendered in the data!

The following is a data dictionary of the variables used

| variable            | class     | description                                                                                             |
|:--------------------|:----------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| movie_name          | character | Name of the film                                                                                        |
| release_year        | integer   | Release year                                                                                            |
| director            | character | Director of the film                                                                                    |
| age_difference      | integer   | Age difference between the characters in whole years                                                    |
| couple_number       | integer   | An identifier for the couple in case multiple couples are listed for this film                          |
| actor_1\_name       | character | The name of the older actor in this couple                                                              |
| actor_2\_name       | character | The name of the younger actor in this couple                                                            |
| character_1\_gender | character | The gender of the older character, as identified by the person who submitted the data for this couple   |
| character_2\_gender | character | The gender of the younger character, as identified by the person who submitted the data for this couple |
| actor_1\_birthdate  | date      | The birthdate of the older member of the couple                                                         |
| actor_2\_birthdate  | date      | The birthdate of the younger member of the couple                                                       |
| actor_1\_age        | integer   | The age of the older actor when the film was released                                                   |
| actor_2\_age        | integer   | The age of the younger actor when the film was released                                                 |

```

How would you explore this data set? Here are some ideas of tables/ graphs to help you with your analysis

-   How is `age_difference` distributed? What's the 'typical' `age_difference` in movies?

-   The `half plus seven\` rule. Large age disparities in relationships carry certain stigmas. One popular rule of thumb is the [half-your-age-plus-seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#The_.22half-your-age-plus-seven.22_rule) rule. This rule states you should never date anyone under half your age plus seven, establishing a minimum boundary on whom one can date. In order for a dating relationship to be acceptable under this rule, your partner's age must be:

$$\frac{\text{Your age}}{2} + 7 < \text{Partner Age} < (\text{Your age} - 7) * 2$$ How frequently does this rule apply in this dataset?

-   Which movie has the greatest number of love interests?
-   Which actors/ actresses have the greatest number of love interests in this dataset?
-   Is the mean/median age difference staying constant over the years (1935 - 2022)?
-   How frequently does Hollywood depict same-gender love interests?

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
